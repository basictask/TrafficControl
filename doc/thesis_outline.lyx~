Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In recent years the traffic of cities became a rising topic with more and
 more city governments realizing that a motor-focused city design is unsustainab
le.
 Cities all around western Europe have started designing their cities around
 humans and public transit, and not around cars.
 If we take a look at how the Dutch infrastructure is designed, we will
 see that despita having less car lanes and overall less space for cars,
 the traffic flows more smoothly.
 This is thanks to the intelligent design of intersections, traffic lights
 and infrastructure.
 The know-how of this has been known ever since the 1970s, but the auto
 industry has been fighting against it ever since in order to gain more
 market.
 The basis of how to create walkable, human-centered and intelligent infrastruct
ure that is optimal for both pedestrians and cars is written in the book
 by Strong Towns, an urban planning organization.

\begin_layout Standard
My plan is to build an interface that models traffic flow in a graph-based
 structure, then train a reinforcement learning algorithm to find the optimal
 configuration of the roads in order to transport the most cars in the most
 effective way possible.
 Here's when the urban design principles come in: one can easily observe
 that the most effective way to transport as many cars as possible is if
 all roads are 8-lane highways.
 However it's also easy to see that it's miserable to live in a city where
 there are no quiet, auto-low streets and only 8-lane highways.
 This might be the best configuration for cars, but it would make the life
 of people living in the city absolutely horrible.
 The rewarding system of the reinforcement learning environment will be
 designed in order to reflect these principles: building cost, traffic light/rou
ndabout tradeoffs, how humans would feel living next to the road.
 The agent will have to decide where to build, destruct, or make roads 1-way
 to make the city's transportation flow dynamic but also make it livable
 for humans.
