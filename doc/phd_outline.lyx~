\begin_layout Title
Traffic Control and Infrastructure Organization Using Reinforcement Learning
\end_layout

\begin_layout Author

2022 Fall Semester
\end_layout

\begin_layout Abstract
The purpose of this research was to develop a reinforcement learning model
 that can optimize traffic flow in a city by building roads, lanes and intersect
ions between predefined nodes that are defined on a user-friendly interface.
 The model will take into account how fast and dynamically does traffic
 flow and how friendly a city is to its residents: the number of lanes and
 infrastructure cost have to be minimal while also minimizing the time taken
 to travel between junctions.
 To conduct the experiment, the machine learning model uses a simulated
 environment that incorporates an intelligent driver model in order to provide
 the most accurate mapping between real life and the modeled environment.
 Future uses cases include optimizing current road structure and generating
 new paths between already existing cities or settlements that use the least
 amount of taxpayer money while also providing them with the fastest travel
 times.
 The developed framework can also be generalized for uses in public transport:
 using smart forecasting to optimize bus or train lanes to cover the most
 area, for as many people as possible.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Historic overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In recent years the traffic of cities became a rising topic with more and
 more city governments realizing that a motor-focused city design is unsustainab
le.
 Cities all around western Europe have started designing their cities around
 humans and public transit, and not around cars.
 E.g.
 Paris is planning to be a 15-minute city, Barcelona is incorporating the
 superblock design, Finland is creating non-intersecting paths between the
 common intersections and the Dutch are using intelligent traffic light
 systems to manipulate traffic flow in order to optimize it for both cars
 and pedestrians.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one takes a look at how the Dutch infrastructure is designed, they will
 see that despite having less car lanes and overall less space for cars,
 the traffic flows more smoothly.
 This is thanks to the intelligent design of intersections, traffic lights
 and infrastructure.
 The methodology of this has been known ever since the 1970s, but the auto
 industry has been fighting against it ever since in order to gain more
 market.
 In Northern America one can observe what happens if a city is designed
 with cars in mind, requiring everyone to own a vehicle in order to participate
 in society.
 This results in worse accessibility to the city for the disabled, incapable,
 elderly and young people as well.
 The methodology of how to create walkable, human-centered and intelligent
 infrastructure that is optimal for both pedestrians and cars is laid out
 in detail by books from authors such as Strong Towns, an urban planning
 organization.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aim for this research is to able to model a system of roads or city,
 and being able to pinpoint mistakes made by development engineers, with
 the goal in mind to make the city more humanly livable, liquidate urban
 highways and make traffic infrastructure more efficient.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Goals and Outline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The project will focus on building an interface that models traffic flow
 in a graph-based structure, then train a reinforcement learning algorithm
 to find the optimal configuration of the roads in order to transport the
 most cars in the most effective way possible.
 Here's when the urban design principles come in: one can easily observe
 that the most effective way to transport as many cars as possible is if
 all roads are 8-lane highways.
 However it's also easy to see that it's miserable to live in a city where
 there are no quiet, auto-low streets and only 8-lane highways.
 This might be the best configuration for cars, but it would make the life
 of people living in the city absolutely horrible.
 The rewarding system of the reinforcement learning environment will be
 designed in order to reflect these principles: building cost, traffic light/rou
ndabout tradeoffs, how humans would feel living next to the road.
 The agent will have to decide where to build, destruct, or make roads 1-way
 to make the city's transportation flow dynamic but also make it livable
 for humans.
 The rewarding scheme will reflect the principles laid down by Strong Towns
 and other urban planning organizations significant in the field like Happy
 Cities: Transforming Our Lives through urban design.

Methodology
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Constructing a city 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The developed software will provide an interface where the user can make
 a graph, describing the intersections (nodes) and roads (edges) of the
 city in question.
 This for example can be done in GeoGebra and exported into a construction
 protocol in order to work as an input for the model.
 Below is an example simple city constructed:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\begin_inset Float figure

wide false
sideways false
status collapsed

\begin_layout Plain Layout

	width 8cm
	height 8cm
	keepAspectRatio

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The interface will read a construction protocol, construct a graph and all
 the possible pathways from it.
 As a starting configuration every road is 2-way on the edges that have
 been defined in the graph.
 The vehicle rate and distribution can be controlled before starting the
 simulation.
 A constructed

starting

\end_inset

 city according to the previously shown graph will look like as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard

\end_layout

\end_layout

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
So far this is a simple setup for demonstration.
 The vehicles are passing from one entry point to another, without necessarily
 choosing the shortest path, or being evenly distributed among all the roads,
 just as one would find in real life.
 The driver model will incorporate an intelligent behavior, like slowing
 down after the car in front is slowing down or gradually speeding up after
 a light has turned green with a comfortable acceleration parameter.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The road configuration will be examined with multiple metrics like how many
 steps does it take for the roads to transport 100 cars or how much the
 road infrastructure would cost.
 If the agent is handed a road configuration it will be able to find the
 optimal one, with the least cost, least unnecessary roads and fastest transport
ation for a given amount of cars.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a distant goal it would also be reasonable for the application to accept
 Osmosis data and construct a graph based on that.
 This would require a more sophisticated preprocessor as the Osmosis data
 would have to be stripped of metadata and guarantees of format conversions
 between world-coordinates and graph-node coordinates would have to be implement
ed.
 However it is possible to convert into the inner representation format
 of the road simulation module.
 Osmosis construction has the following steps:

\begin_layout Section
Intelligent driver model
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The intelligent driver model is a time-continuous car following model for
 the simulation of urban traffic.
 It describes the behavior of the drivers.
 and the positions of vehicles.
 The model defines 6 parameters that influence how a driver behaves:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $v_{0}$
\end_inset

: The desired velocity of the vehicle.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $T$
\end_inset

: Safe following time.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

: Maximum acceleration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $b$
\end_inset

: Comfortable deceleration.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

: Acceleration exponent.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
\begin_inset Formula $s_{0}$
\end_inset

: Minimum distance.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using these variables and the positions of other vehicles it is possible
 at every time step to completely determine the position of every vehicle.
 Furthermore, vehicles can influence eachothers' positions, as there can
 be car pileups in an intersection with cars waiting for eachother.
 This model will consider only cars of uniform size, without taking into
 account other types of vehicles like vans and semitrucks.
 Every driver is assumed to have the same skillset e.g.
 safe following time, comfortable deceleration and so on.
 This can be a fairly good approximation of a real world driver's parameters.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Deep learning architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Action space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A starting configuration will provide the agent with a 2-way road between
 each graph node.
 From here on the goal is to add / destroy roads, lanes and intersections
 in order to optimize the throughput and cost of the road.
 Each action of the agent will take two graph nodes as a parameter and the
 roads will be configured accordingly.
 Any action for node 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 will assume a single directed edge 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow B$
\end_inset

 starting for 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and ending in 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 There are cases where semantically it would make more sense to have more
 or less than 2 parameters but these cases can be generalized to an action
 with two parameters and hence be channeled into a neural network output
 of the same shape and size as all other cases.

\begin_layout Subsection
State space
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Representation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the plan will focus on how to represent a certain type of road between
 two nodes.
 The state between graph node 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 will have to be represented by a single number in every case.
 The bases that this scalar value will have to cover the number of lanes
 between 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow B$
\end_inset

 and the type of intersection in the node 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For a state-vector element corresponding to the one-way connection between
 nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 the possible values are as follows:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
One-lane road between 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow B\Rightarrow1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Two-lane road betwen 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow B\Rightarrow2$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Two-way road, one lane in each direction: 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow B\Rightarrow1;$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $B\rightarrow A\Rightarrow1$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Two way road, two lanes in each direction: 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow B\Rightarrow2;$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $B\rightarrow A\Rightarrow2$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
One-lane road ending in roundabout between 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow B\Rightarrow11$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
Two-lane road ending in a traffic light junction between 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow B\Rightarrow22$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The state vector keeps track of the connections in a directed fashion, storing
 the number of lanes from 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B\rightarrow A$
\end_inset

 in separate values.
 A single scalar of 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 means that it's a 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

-laned road ending in a right-hand priority intersection without any dedicated
 infrastructure.
 A scalar of value 
\begin_inset Formula $10<k<20$
\end_inset

 means that the road ends in a roundabout.
 A scalar of value 
\begin_inset Formula $20<k<30$
\end_inset

 means that the road ends in a traffic light based junction.
 The last digit always translates to the number of lanes going from 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrow B$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Naive implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The state space requires precise designing and execution as there's a possibilit
y of exponential explosion if it's represented using an all-to-all fashion.
 If the state space keeps track of all the incoming connections from all
 the nodes to all other nodes, for a graph 
\begin_inset Formula $G$
\end_inset

 of nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{1},N_{2},\ldots,N_{k}$
\end_inset

the state space will require a vector of length 
\begin_inset Formula $k^{2}-k$
\end_inset

.
 There's no need to keep record of connections to and from the same node
 (self-loops): 
\begin_inset Formula $N_{i}\rightarrow N_{i}=\emptyset;\forall i\in[1,k]$
\end_inset

.

\begin_layout Standard
This gives reason to explore the possibilities of being able to shorten
 the state space vector by eliminating connectioins that are for sure not
 going to participate in the learning.
 The rationale behind this is that it's an errenous design decision to connect
 the furthest junctions with direct roads.
 This would mean destroying currently existing residential zoning and thereby
 cut the city in half.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Radius-based approach
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It's easy to notice that it isn't needed to have roads connecting all intersecti
ons with all other intersections.
 This would make the city a convoluted mess.
 A valid approach to reduce the size of the state vector is to define a
 radius around the nodes and only store the number of lanes between them.
 For this a radius parameter will have to be input in order to define the
 possible connections before running the simulation.
 On the image below an example of such a circle is shown for graph node
 
\begin_inset Formula $E$
\end_inset

 with the radius of 150.

\begin_layout Standard
It is fairly straightforward to see that this would result in a configuration
 where no road's length exceeds the radius of the neighborhood.
 This can be considered as a good design approach because it would eliminate
 the need to build long and straight roads through the city which are shown
 to be more dangerous regarding traffic accidents.
 The reason for this is that motorists can go with higher speeds as the
 road is wide and forgiving like a highway.
 It is empirically shown that the best way to reduce speeds is to force
 the drivers to obey speed limits by creating the geometry of the road in
 a way that enforces it.
 One won't go with 70-90 km/h on a street that is say 150 meters long.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The disadvantage of this method is that the state vector would be unevenly
 distributed between the nodes of the graph.
 Some of the nodes would have more elements in the vector than others resulting
 an unnecessary high representation.
 It's also possible that an outlier node gets cut off from the rest, and
 becomes an 'island' that is unreachable from anywhere.
 This happening is considered a design fail.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
NN-based method
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The number of tracked connections in the state vector can also be reduced
 if only the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 nearest neighbors to a node is allowed.
 This would allow for a more evenly distributed state representation as
 for each node there's only a need to register 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 connections instead of 
\begin_inset Formula $k-1$
\end_inset

.
 This approach would however also limit the number of incoming connections
 into a junction.
 E.g.
 if the parameter is set to 
\begin_inset Formula $m=4$
\end_inset

 the previously shown graph would not be possible to construct and some
 node may be separated from all other ones, isolating them from the rest
 of the infrastructure.
 This is considered a bad resolution of the problem, but the approach can
 be used in combination with other approaches.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Practical implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A combination of the previously mentioned methods can also be taken into
 consideration in order to reduce the state vector size, e.g.
 allowing connections from a specific radius but in cases where there's
 not a sufficient number of possible neighboring nodes the system will have
 to find the 
\begin_inset Formula $m$
\end_inset

 closest nodes and keep track of roads coming and going from them.
 It's also worth noting that combining the advantages of the two methods
 intelligently can yield a representation where each node has a specific,
 even number of connections that is significantly less than the total number
 of nodes in the system.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Rewarding mechanism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At each time step in the reinforcement learning agent-environment framework,
 the agent takes an action and as a result, the environment changes its
 state and returns a reward to the environment.
 The agent can also observe the environment through the state variable described
 in the previous section.
 This part will deal with the principles that will be reflected during sending
 the reward signal to the agent.
 The main directives like exact costs and traffic engineering perspectives
 will be further explored in the literature review.
 For now it's enough to deal with the main.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main goal for the agent is to build a city that is livable for humans
 by keeping the number of lanes and roads to the minimum at all times.
 If this constraint was not present, the agent could simply build 8-lane
 highways in streets that are a few hundred meters long.
 This would render being a pedestrian miserable.
 It's also necessary to not build roads between nodes that is not necessary
 from a transportation perspective.
 If there's a reasonable detour between two endpoints, the cars should take
 that road.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Inter-node infrastructure
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The cost of building a lane has to be taken into consideration.
 It is more expensive to add new lanes to existing infrastructure than to
 build the first lanes at the beginning.
 This is because the sidewalk has to be destructed and then rebuilt.
 Also traffic flow is slower in the time of the construction because of
 closed roads, leading to congestions.
 Out of the 7 possible actions of the agent 4 are in relation to building
 roads and lanes.
 The relationship between them is the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The cost of building and destroying is linearly dependend on the length
 of the segment.
 The length cost of a unit of lane is 
\begin_inset Formula $l_{lane}.$
\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The cost of building a unit (e.g.
 meter) of one-way lane is: 
\begin_inset Formula $c_{lane}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The cost of building a lane is taken as 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{lane}=c_{lane}*l_{lane}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The cost of building a road is equivalent to building two lanes: 
\begin_inset Formula $b_{road}=2b_{lane}=2*c_{lane}*l_{lane}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
The cost of destroying a lane is less than building a lane.
 The coefficient parameter is denoted 
\begin_inset Formula $\delta$
\end_inset

: 
\begin_inset Formula $0<\delta<1$
\end_inset

 Then the cost of destroying is: 
\begin_inset Formula $d_{lane}=\delta b_{lane}=\delta*c_{lane}*l_{lane}$
\end_inset

Then the cost of destroying a road:

 unsafe.
 Cheap to build and to maintain.
 Also inexpensive to convert to from all other types of junctions.

As a graph node must be at all times assigned to a type of junction, and
 each type can be converted into any other type, the relationship between
 them can be defined by a triangle.
 The cost of converting from one to another can be parametrized and can
 be subject to change depending on how expensive building infrastructure
 is on a given terrain or economical environment.
 The conversion table is shown below:

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The conversion will require the inputs to and from each type of intersection,
 as these are not necessarily functions on eachother.
 Some dependency can be added later but that is independent of the current
 high-level model.
 The required inputs are: 
\begin_inset Formula $\alpha,\alpha\prime,\beta,\beta\prime,\gamma,\gamma\prime$
\end_inset

.
 Each variable represents a conversion cost between two types of infrastructure.
 The prime version of the variable is the reverse of the same building procedure.
 The prime (
\begin_inset Formula $'$
\end_inset

) will always reflect a 
\emph on
'destruction'
\emph default
 e.g.
 demolishing an expensive piece of infrastructure and building a cheaper
 one in place.
 The non-prime variable denotes the building of a more expensive piece of
 infrastructure from a cheaper one.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are limiting factors to different types of junctions e.g.
 how many roads can it intersect.
 The roundabout is famous for being able to intersect five or more roads
 without any problem, because of the structure of it.
 Traffic lights can also have more roads than average coming in and out
 of it.
 For the most part right-hand intersections can handle at most four bidirectiona
l roads.
 This is because human attention cannot be focused to so many places at
 the same time.
 More roads will translate to a more dangerous environment and will require
 highly dedicated infrastructure.
 It is possible, but it's rarely seen in the real world and the cost will
 have to be tuned accordingly.

It's easy to observe that the machine learning model has a particularly
 difficult job in this case.
 The action it has to take in each iteration consists of multiple variables,
 not just a single one: 
\begin_inset Formula $A\stackrel{a}{\rightarrow}B$
\end_inset

.
 For this reason a highly specialized deep learning configuration is needed.
 The input vector is the size of the state space as described by the node
 connections in section 5.2 of this chapter and the number and size of the
 hidden layers is highly dependant on the size of the input graph, so the
 rest of this section will deal with the problem of predicting 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 First the 
\emph on
'to'
\emph default
 and 
\emph on
'from'
\emph default
 node prediction will be taken into account.
 For this there are two proposed architectures, the single and the multi-headed
 ones.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Single-head architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This is a simple configuration that uses a feedforward network to predict
 nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 The input is the state vector, and there are an arbitrary number of hidden
 layers.
 This has been denoted as 
\begin_inset Formula $\ldots$
\end_inset

 in the figure.
 In the prediction phase of the modeling the model first predicts 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

, then based on that prediction produces a prediction for graph node 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Both of the predictions use softmax nodes that estimates the probability
 
\begin_inset Formula $\hat{p_{k}}$
\end_inset

 that the action belongs to action class 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 thereby choosing an action from 
\begin_inset Formula $a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{7}$
\end_inset

, where 
\begin_inset Formula $k\in\{1,2,\ldots,7\}$
\end_inset

.
 For 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

 as the number of classes the softmax function is defined as:
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{p_{k}}=\sigma(s(x))_{k}=\frac{exp(s_{k}(x))}{\sum_{j=i}^{k}exp(s_{j}(x))}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Where 
\begin_inset Formula $s(x)$
\end_inset

 is a vector containing the scores for each action of the current state
 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $\sigma(s(x))_{k}$
\end_inset

 is the estimated probability that the state vector 
\begin_inset Formula $x$
\end_inset

 belongs to class 
\begin_inset Formula $k$
\end_inset

, given the scores for each class of that instance.
 The final prediction is the class where the probability is the highest.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
\hat{y}=\underset{k}{argmax}\sigma(s(x))_{k}
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this case the prediction is a node from the set of all nodes.
 Another important criterion is that 
\begin_inset Formula $A\neq B$
\end_inset

.
 In the case where the two predictions match the agent should either run
 the prediction again or receive a negative reward to penalize the weight
 within the neural network.
 This research denotes a softmax unit that predicts class C as 
\begin_inset Formula $softmax(C)$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Multi-head architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another way of predicting the starting and ending nodes is by using two
 heads on the same neural network.
 In this case the last hidden node will be in connection with both the softmax
 neurons:

In the same way as before, the two predictions must be different.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Comparison
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This part is dedicated to describing the advantages and disadvantages of
 the two proposed network architectures.
 The main idea behind the single-head (SH) architecture is that the neural
 network has connections between the two prediction nodes, so the 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 node will be dependant on the 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 node.
 This is very useful in learning what junctions are close to eachother and
 are relevant in building the infrastructure and also has a built-in way
 of learning that the two nodes should be different.
 However in the SH configuration the 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 node has no prior information about the state vector as it has already
 been accumulated in the softmax node.
 The output of the softmax node is a single class, therefore the B node
 should be only predicted based on that integer number.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The multi-head architecture (MH) can counter this problem: both prediction
 nodes are in connection with the last hidden state vector, therefore they
 both have knowledge of the information extracted.
 This leads to a problem where the two nodes have no connection to eachother,
 hence there is no way to actively penalize predictions where the two outputs
 match.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A practical realization of this problem is to introduce a skip connection
 between the last hidden unit and the 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

 node.
 Using this method the 
\emph on
'to'
\emph default
 node would acquire knowledge about the 
\emph on
'from' 
\emph default
node and the information extracted by the neural network.
 A high-level architectural diagram of this approach is shown below:

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Action-prediction architecture
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The last task of the network is to predict what action to take between the
 nodes 
\begin_inset Formula $A$
\end_inset

 and 
\begin_inset Formula $B$
\end_inset

.
 The action denotes if the agent will build or destroy lanes or change the
 type of the intersection.
 For this purpose it's necessary that the network has knowledge about the
 predictions made on the two softmax nodes defined in the previous section.
 It's also essential that the network can access the state vector transformed
 by the hidden units and the current state of the graph connection, e.g.
 how many lanes it currently has and what type of intersection is currently
 built there.
 The proposed architecture is as follows:

Practical implementation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If the architecture was made by the method defined before, it would require
 two separate neural networks, one for predicting 
\begin_inset Formula $A,B$
\end_inset

 and one for 
\begin_inset Formula $a$
\end_inset

.
 This would be errenous in practice as two complete neural networks would
 have to be trained separately.
 This approach is redundant and can lead to information being lost and increased
 computation times.
 In practice it's beneficial to have a single neural network that trains,
 and can be able to predict 3 target variables in a single pass.
 This is also a good approach in the sense that there are dependencies between
 the variables: 
\begin_inset Formula $A\rightarrowtriangle B;\:A\rightarrowtriangle a;\:B\rightarrowtriangle a;\:x(A,B)\rightarrowtriangle a$
\end_inset

.
 These dependencies can be brought into the same neural network using the
 architectural design below:
